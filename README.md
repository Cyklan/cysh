# cysh

A basic unix shell written in C.

The base of this code was created with help of [this tutorial](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/). It will be altered in the future to add more features.

Current Built in tools are

- cd [Changes Directory]
- help [Displays simple help and info about cysh]
- exit [stops cysh]
